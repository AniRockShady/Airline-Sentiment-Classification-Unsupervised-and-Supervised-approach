In the ever-evolving landscape of the airline industry, customer sentiments play a pivotal role in shaping perceptions and influencing business outcomes. This study delves into the intricate world of airline sentiment analysis, focusing on the application of unsupervised learning using VADER scoring techniques. By leveraging this technique, the objective is to decipher the nuanced emotions expressed in customer feedback, allowing airlines to glean actionable insights for refining their services, addressing pain points, and ultimately elevating the overall passenger experience.<br><br>
In addition to exploring sentiments within airline customer reviews, this study employs supervised classification methods such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifiers, and Random Forest models to predict and classify sentiments. The reviews undergo transformation using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scoring, a technique that captures the significance of words in a document relative to the entire corpus. By integrating these algorithms with TF-IDF scoring, the research seeks not only to analyse existing sentiments but also to predict and classify sentiments in ‘unseen’ reviews. This dual approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer sentiments in the airline industry and to equip airlines with predictive tools for proactive service improvement. This exploration at the intersection of machine learning and customer sentiment aims to contribute to the ongoing pursuit of excellence in the aviation sector.
